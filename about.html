        <h1>About HelmingSense</h1>

        <p><strong>HelmingSense was born from the quiet need for clarity at sea.</strong></p>

        <p>Created by a long-distance cruising sailor and open-source tinkerer, HelmingSense brings together real-world practicality with technical finesse. Built around a Raspberry Pi and the Signal K ecosystem, it’s a modular, expandable system that delivers meaningful data — rudder angle, RPM, motion, temperatures — all through a clean, intuitive dashboard.</p>

        <p>But HelmingSense isn’t just about numbers. It’s about insight.</p>

        <p><strong>What makes HelmingSense different is its ability to assist with sail trim — intelligently.</strong> By analysing weather helm and heeling angle, the dashboard can help the skipper optimise trim for both speed and comfort. It bridges the gap between hardware and helming technique, offering suggestions to fine-tune the boat’s balance in real time.</p>

        <p>Whether you're reefed down in a rising wind or easing sheets for a lazy reach, HelmingSense becomes part of your feel for the boat — another hand on the helm, quietly helping.</p>

        <p>Designed aboard a twin-keel Sadler 34 and tested through real-world refits, HelmingSense is built for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cruising couples and solo sailors</li>
            <li>Skippers who want independence without isolation</li>
            <li>Enthusiasts who value open systems over locked-in electronics</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>If you're curious, committed, or just passionate about better sailing — you’re in the right place.</strong></p>
